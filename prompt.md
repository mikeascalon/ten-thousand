## Input 
give me a python file that have this 
Define a GameLogic class in ten_thousand/game_logic.py file.
Handle calculating score for dice roll
Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to rules of game.
Handle rolling dice
Add roll_dice static method to GameLogic class.
The input to roll_dice is an integer between 1 and 6.
The output of roll_dice is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6.
The length of tuple must match the argument given to roll_dice method.

Here's a Python file that defines a GameLogic class in a file named game_logic.py with the specified functionality:

```python
import random

User
i need the roll_dice to handle this test
